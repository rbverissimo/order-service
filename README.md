# order-service
This is part of a study series on microservices architectural patterns. In this repo lies an Order Service written in Python using FastApi alongside with Postgres and SQLAlchemy. As the naming implies, order services are responsible for processing orders and publishing them to a message broker (we're using Kafka for this).
